                <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
                    quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
                    prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

            <ol class="custom-ol">
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form
                    a paste. Add
                    water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
                    to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
                <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
                    slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust.
                    Pour slowly so
                    that it does not run off.</li>
                <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
                    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
