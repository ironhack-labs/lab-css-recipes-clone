      <p class="recipe">This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. <br> It will always
        be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. <br> I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!</p>

      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br> flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring

        slightly. <br> Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar <br> and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
