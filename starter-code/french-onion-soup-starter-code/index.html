     continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the onions.<br>
     
     2) Add beef broth, sherry and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 30
     minutes.<br>
     
     3) Heat the oven broiler. <br>

     4) Ladle soup into oven safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each
