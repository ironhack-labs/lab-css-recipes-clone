<p class="oui"> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br>
quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>
prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well! </p>

 <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>
temperature and let simmer. </li>

<li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
that it does not run off.</li>

<li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft. </li>
