          quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>
          prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <ol>
    <li> oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
    flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
    temperature and let simmer.</li>
    
    <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
    lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off.</li>
    
    <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
