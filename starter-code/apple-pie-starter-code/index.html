                This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br/>
                quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place<br/>
                prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!<br/>

        <article class="container box-article">
            Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br/>
            flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce<br/>
            temperature and let simmer.<br/>
            
            Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a<br/>
            lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br/>
            that it does not run off.<br/>
            
            Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br/>
            degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
