    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
        quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
        prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <p>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
      temperature and let simmer.<br><br> 2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
      that it does not run off. <br><br> 3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
