								<p class="paragraph">This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
									<br>
          quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
										<br>
          prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

																			<h2>Directions</h2>
																			<br>
																				<p class="paragraph2">1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
																					<br>
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
																						<br>
      temperature and let simmer.
      
																							<br>
      2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
																								<br>
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
																									<br>
      that it does not run off.
      
																										<br>
      3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
																											<br>
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
