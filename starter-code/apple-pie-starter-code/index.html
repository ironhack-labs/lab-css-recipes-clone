    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br>
    quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>
    prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well! <br>

      <h2>Directions</h2> 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>
            flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>
            temperature and let simmer. <br>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>
            lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
            that it does not run off. <br>
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
            degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft. <br>
