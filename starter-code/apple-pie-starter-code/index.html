<div>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</div>

<h3>Directions</h3><br>
1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
temperature and let simmer.<br><br>

2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
that it does not run off.<br><br>

3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
