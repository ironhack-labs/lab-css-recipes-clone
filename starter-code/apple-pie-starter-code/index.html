<pre>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
temperature and let simmer.<br>

2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
that it does not run off.<br>

3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
