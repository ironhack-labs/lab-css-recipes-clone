            This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
            one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
            first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
            favorites as well!

        Directions
      </h2>
      
        1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
            saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and
            brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. <br>
        2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly.
            Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid
            over the crust. <br>
         3)Pour slowly so that it does not run off. Bake 15 minutes
            in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
            degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
