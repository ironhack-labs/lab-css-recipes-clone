            <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it.</p>
            <p>It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. </p>
            <p>I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br> flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>temperature and let simmer.</p>
        <p>2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>that it does not run off.</p>
        <p>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). <br>Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
