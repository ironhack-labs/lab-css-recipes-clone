        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
        one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
        first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

        <ol class ="font-serif">
          <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the
            butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white
            sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let
            simmer.</li>
          <li> Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
            slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
            butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
            <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
              degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until
              apples are soft.</li>
