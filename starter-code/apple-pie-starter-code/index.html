    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan.<br>
Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil.<br>   Reduce temperature and let simmer.<br>
2. Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly sothat it does not run off. <br>
