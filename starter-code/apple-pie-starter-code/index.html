            <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

        <div class="how-to-cook">
          1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.<br>
          2) Place the bottom crust in your pan.<br>
        Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.<br>
          3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees
        F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.<br>
