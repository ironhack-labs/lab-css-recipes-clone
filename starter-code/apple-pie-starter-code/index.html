  <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
      quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
      prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. 
      Stir in flour to form a paste. 
      Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
      temperature and let simmer.</li>
    <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. 
      Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
    <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
