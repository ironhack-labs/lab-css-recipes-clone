    <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
      <br> quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
      <br> prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

    </h2>
    <ol class="textsection3">
      <li> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br> flour to form a paste. Add water,
        white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>temperature and let simmer.
      </li>
      <li> Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>lattice work crust. Gently pour
        the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>that it does not run off.
      </li>
      <li> Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br> degrees C). Continue baking for
        35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
