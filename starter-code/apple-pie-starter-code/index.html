  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <div class = "olist">
  <p>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>
  flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>
  temperature and let simmer.<br>
  2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>
  lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
  that it does not run off.<br>
  3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
  degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
