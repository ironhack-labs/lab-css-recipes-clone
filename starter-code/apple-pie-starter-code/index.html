      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
      <br>quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
      <br>prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

    <ol class="tex2">
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
        <br>flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
        <br>temperature and let simmer.
      </li>
      <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
        <br>lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
        <br>that it does not run off.
      </li>
      <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      <br>degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
