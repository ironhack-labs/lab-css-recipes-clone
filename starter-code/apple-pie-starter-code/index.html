  <h2>Apple Pies</h2>

  <div>
  This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
  temperature and let simmer.</li>

<li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
  that it does not run off.</li>

<li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
  degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
