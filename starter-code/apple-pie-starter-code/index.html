<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
<li class="list-padding">Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
temperature and let simmer.</li>

lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
that it does not run off.</li>

degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
