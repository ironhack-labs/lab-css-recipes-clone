    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</li>
<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
<li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
<li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
<li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
<li>8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
</ul>
 </div>



Directions
<p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
temperature and let simmer.</p>

<p>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
that it does not run off.</p>

<p>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
