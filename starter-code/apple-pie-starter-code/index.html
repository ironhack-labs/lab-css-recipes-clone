          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
          quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
          prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</ul>
          <ul>1/2 cup unsalted butter</ul>
          <ul>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</ul>
          <ul>1/4 cup water</ul>
          <ul>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</ul>
          <ul>1/4 cup water</ul>
          <ul>1/2 cup white sugar</ul>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
      temperature and let simmer.</p>

      <p>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
      that it does not run off.</p>

      <p>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
