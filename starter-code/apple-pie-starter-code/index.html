					1&#41; Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
				</li>

					2&#41; Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a	lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
