    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
        quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
        prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
      temperature and let simmer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
      that it does not run off 
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
