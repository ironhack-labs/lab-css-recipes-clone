              <br>
              <ul>
                <li id = "instruction">1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
                    flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
                    temperature and let simmer.</li>
                <li id = "instruction">2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
                    lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
                    that it does not run off.</li>
                <li id = "instruction">3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
                    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
