<h2>Directions</h2>
<ul>  
  <li>1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
    flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
    temperature and let simmer.</li>
  <li>2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
    lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off.</li>
  <li>3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
     degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
