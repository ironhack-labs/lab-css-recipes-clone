<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
	flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
	temperature and let simmer.</li>

	<li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
	lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
	that it does not run off.</li>

	<li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
	degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
