      <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
        quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
        prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <article>
        <p>1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
          flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
          temperature and let simmer.</p>
        <p>2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
          lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
          that it does not run off.</p>
        <p>3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
