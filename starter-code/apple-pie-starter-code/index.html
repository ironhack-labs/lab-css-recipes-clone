      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
      quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
      prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li class="basic">
      <ul>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</ul>
      <ul>1/2 cup unsalted butter</ul>
      <ul>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</ul>
      <ul>1/4 cup water</ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <li class="basic"></li>
      <ol>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
      temperature and let simmer.</ol>

      Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
      that it does not run off.

      Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
