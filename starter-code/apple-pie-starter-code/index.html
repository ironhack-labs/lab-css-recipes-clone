    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and
    has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

    <h2>  Directions </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
           Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add
          water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. 
      </li>
      <li>
          Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid
          over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
      </li>
      <li>
          Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature
          to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
