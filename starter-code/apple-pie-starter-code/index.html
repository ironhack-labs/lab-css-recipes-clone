<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol class= "list">
  <li> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
      temperature and let simmer. </li>
  <li> Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
      that it does not run off. </li>
  <li> Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft. </li>

</ol>
