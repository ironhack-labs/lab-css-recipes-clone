      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br>
      quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place<br>
      prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!<br>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <li>
      1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>
      temperature and let simmer.

    </li>

    <li>
        2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
      that it does not run off.
    </li>

    <li>
        3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
    </li>
