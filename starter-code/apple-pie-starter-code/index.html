    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br>
    quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>
    prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>
    flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>
    temperature and let simmer. <br><br>

    Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>
    lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
    that it does not run off.<br><br>

    Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.<br>
