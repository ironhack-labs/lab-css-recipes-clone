<h1>Directions</h1>
<ol class="steps-pie">
<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br>
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce<br>
temperature and let simmer.</li>

<li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a<br>
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
that it does not run off.</li>

<li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
</ol>
