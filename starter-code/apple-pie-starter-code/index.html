  <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br>
  quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place<br>
  prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<br>
<br>
<div class="lastclass">
<p>1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br>
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce<br>
temperature and let simmer.</p>

<p>2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a<br>
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
that it does not run off.</p>

<p>3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
