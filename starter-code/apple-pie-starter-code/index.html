          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
          quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
          prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

        <ol>

              <p>
                  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
                  flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
                  temperature and let simmer.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
                  lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
                  that it does not run off.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
                  degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
