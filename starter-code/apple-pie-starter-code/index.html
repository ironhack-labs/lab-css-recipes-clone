        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br>
        quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place<br>
        prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    
    <ol class="list2">
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br>
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce<br>
      temperature and let simmer.</li>

      <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a<br>
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
      that it does not run off.</li>

      <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
