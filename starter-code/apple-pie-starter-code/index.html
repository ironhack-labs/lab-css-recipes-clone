     <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br>
     quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>
     prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well! </p>

     <h3>Directions</h3>
     <p> 1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>
     flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>
     temperature and let simmer. </p>
     
    <p> 2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>
     lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
     that it does not run off. </p>
     
     <p>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
     degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft. </p>
