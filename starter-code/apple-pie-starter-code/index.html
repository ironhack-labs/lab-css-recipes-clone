<p class="firstPara">This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one</br>
quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place</br>
prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>
<p id="secPara">Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in</br>
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce</br>
temperature and let simmer.</br>

Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a</br>
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so</br>
that it does not run off.</br>

Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175</br>
degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
