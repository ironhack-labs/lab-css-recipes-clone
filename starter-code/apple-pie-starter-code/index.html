  <p class="parag1">This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
   quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
   prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="directions">
  <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
      temperature and let simmer.</li>
  <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
      that it does not run off.</li>
  <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
