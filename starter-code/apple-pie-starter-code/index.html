<p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
temperature and let simmer. </li>

lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
that it does not run off. </li>
