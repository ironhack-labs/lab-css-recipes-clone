          <p>
            
              This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
            quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
            prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

            <h3>Directions</h3>

            <p>1.Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
                flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
                temperature and let simmer.
                </p>

            <p>2.Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
                lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
                that it does not run off.
                </p>

            <p>3.Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
                degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
