<p class="history">
    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
    quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
    prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

  Directions
</h2>

<p class="step-by-step">
  1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
  flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
  temperature and let simmer.
</p>
      
<p>
  2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
  lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
  that it does not run off.
</p>
      
<p>  
  3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
  degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
