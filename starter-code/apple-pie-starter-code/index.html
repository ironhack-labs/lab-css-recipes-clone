<p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one</br>quite like it. It will 
  always be my favorite and has won me several first place</br>
  prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</br>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <dd>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in</br>
  flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce</br>
  temperature and let simmer.</dd>
<dd>2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a</br>
  lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so</br>
  that it does not run off.</dd>
  <dd>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175</br>
  degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</dd>
