          We have been trying French onion soup in restaurants for years and my
          family and friends agree none can compare to my recipe for taste and
          simplicity of preparation.

        <p>
          Melt butter with olive oil in an 8 quart stock pot on medium heat. Add
          onions and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown
          the onions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add beef broth, sherry and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, and
          simmer for 30 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heat the oven broiler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ladle soup into oven safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread
          on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer
          each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss
          and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Place bowls on cookie sheet and
          broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and browns slightly.
