                This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

                1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan.
                Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil.
                Reduce temperature and let simmer. <br>
                2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly.
                Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid
                over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off. <br>
                3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to
                350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes,
                until apples are soft.
