    <p class="bg-img-subtitle"> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it.
      It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes
      one of your favorites as well! </p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <p>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste.
        Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</p>
      <p>2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust.
        Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</p>
      <p>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue
        baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
