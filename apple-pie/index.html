        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
        one <br />
        quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
        first place <br />
        prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as
        well!

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <p>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
        saucepan. Stir in <br />flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar
        and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br />
        temperature and let simmer.
        <br />
        Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly.
        Cover with a <br />lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter
        liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br />that it does not run off.
        <br />
        Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
        degrees F (175 <br />degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes,
        until apples are soft.
