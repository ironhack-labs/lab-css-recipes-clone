          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br>
          quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br> 
          prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

          Directions 

        </h3>

        <p class = "para">

          1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>
          flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br> 
          temperature and let simmer.<br>
          2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a<br> 
          lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
          that it does not run off.<br> 
          3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
