        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
        one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
        first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
          saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and
          brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
          butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to
          350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes,
          until apples are soft.
