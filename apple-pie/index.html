            1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in
            a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar
            and brown sugar, and bring. <br />2) Place the bottom crust in your
            pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work
            crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour
            slowly so that it does not run off.<br />3) Bake 15 minutes in the
            preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
            C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are
            soft.</span

          This was my grandmother&#39;s apple pie recipe. I have never seen
          another one quite like it. It will always be my favourite and has won
          me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes
          one of your favourites as well!
