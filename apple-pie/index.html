    <p class="ingredients">
    1)reheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
    C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir<br>
    in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce<br>
    temperature and let simmer. <br>

    2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
    slightly. Cover with a <br> lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off. <br>

    3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.<br>
