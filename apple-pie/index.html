          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen
          another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me
          several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one
          of your favorites as well!

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <section class="article-text">          
          <p>
            1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
            saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Ap water, white sugar and
            brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
            slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
            butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
          </p>
          <p>
            3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
            degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until
            apples are soft.
