      <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. 
        I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes 
        in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

    <h2> Directions</h2>
    <p> Directions
      Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
      Melt the butter in a saucepan.
      Stir in flour to form a paste.
      Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil.
      Reduce temperature and let simmer.
      Place the bottom crust in your pan.
      Fill with apples, mounded slightly.
      Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
      Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven.
      Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
