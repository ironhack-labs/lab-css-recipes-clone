      <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
        be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degreesC). Melt the butter in a saucepan. 
          Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring 
          to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. </li>
        <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter 
          liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off. Bake 15 minutes 
          in the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking 
          for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
