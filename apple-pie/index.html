      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br>quite like it. It will always
      be my favorite and has won me several first place<br>prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well!

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
      C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br> flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar,
      and
      bring
      to a boil. Reduce <br> temperature and let simmer.<br>
      2) the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
      slightly. Cover with a <br> lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour
      slowly
      so <br>
      that it does not run off.<br>
      3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
