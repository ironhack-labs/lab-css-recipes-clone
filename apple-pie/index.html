        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a
            paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</dt>
          <dt>2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded sdtghtly. Cover with a lattice work
            crust.
            Gently pour the sugar and butter dtquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</dt>
          <dt>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            Continue
            baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</dt>
