    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!

    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan.
 Stir in flour to form a paste.  Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.  </li>
      <li>   Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off.</li>
    <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
