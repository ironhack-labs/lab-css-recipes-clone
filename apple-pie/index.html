          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
          one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me
          several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes
          one of your favorites as well!

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
          1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
          saucepan. Stir in <br />
          flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and
          bring to a boil. Reduce <br />
          temperature and let simmer.<br />
          2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a <br />
          lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the
          crust. Pour slowly so <br />
          that it does not run off.<br />
          3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
          degrees F (175 <br />
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are
          soft.
