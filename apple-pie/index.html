      <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br>
       quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>
       prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <p>
       1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
       C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
       to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. <br>
       2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
       slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
       that it does not run off. <br>
       3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
