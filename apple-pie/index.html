    <p id="first-paragraph">This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another<br> one quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place<br> prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!</p>

    <h3><b>Directions</b></h3><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br> flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
      to a boil. Reduce<br> temperature and let simmer.</li> 

      <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
      slightly. Cover with a<br> lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
      that it does not run off.</li>

      <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
