    <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
      be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well!

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and
        bring
        to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
        slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly
        so
        that it does not run off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
      </li>
