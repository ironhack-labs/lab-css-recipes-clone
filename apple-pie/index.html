        Apple Pies This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen
        another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me
        several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one
        of your favorites as well!

        saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and

        slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
        butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
