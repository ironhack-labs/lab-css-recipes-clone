                            This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
                            be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
                            favorites as well!

                        1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
                        to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. 
                        <br>
                        2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
                        slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
                        that it does not run off.
                        <br>
                        3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
                        degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
