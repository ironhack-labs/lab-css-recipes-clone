      <p class="introduction"> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
      be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well!

    <h3>Directions </h3>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    
    <p>1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. </p>
    <p style="margin:-2.5% 0;"></p>
    <p>2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off. </p>
    <p style="margin:-2.5% 0;"></p>
    <p>3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
