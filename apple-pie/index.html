      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br>
       quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>
        prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

  <div class="thirdp">

    <p>
      Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in 
      a saucepan. Stir in <br>
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
      to a boil. Reduce <br> temperature and let simmer. <br> 
      Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
      slightly. Cover with a <br>
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
      that it does not run off. <br> 
      Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
