        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
        be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

      <h2>Directions</h2> 
    
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425F (220°C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. 
          Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
        <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice 
          work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350F (175°C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 
          minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
