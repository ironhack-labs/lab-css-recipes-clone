        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
        one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
        first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

        <ol class="direction">
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a
            saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and
            brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
          </li>

          <li>
            Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
            slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
            butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run
            off.
          </li>

          <li>
            Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
            degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes,
            until apples are soft.
