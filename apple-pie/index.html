          Apple Pies This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never
          seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has
          won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it
          becomes one of your favorites as well!

      Directions Preheat
    oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir
    in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. Place the bottom crust in your
    pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust.
    Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that
    it does not run off. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the
    temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45
    minutes, until apples are soft. -->
