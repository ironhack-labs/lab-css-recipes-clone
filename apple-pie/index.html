      favorites as well!

      <li> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a
        paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
      <li> Place the
        bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the
        sugar
        and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
      <li> Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven.
        Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are
