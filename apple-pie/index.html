    <div><h1>Directions<br>

    1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce <br>temperature and let simmer. 

    2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
    slightly. Cover with a <br>lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
    that it does not run off.

    3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</h1>
