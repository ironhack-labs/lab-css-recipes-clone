        <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
        be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

          <h3> Directions </h3>
          <ol>
          
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
              to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. </li>

            <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
              slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
              that it does not run off.</li>

            <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
              degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
