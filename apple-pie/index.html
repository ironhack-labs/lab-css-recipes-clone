    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well! </p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol type="1">
<li>  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>

<li>  Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
    slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off.</li>

<li>  Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft. </li>
