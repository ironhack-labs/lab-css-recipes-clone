      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
      quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first
      place prizes in loclal competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well!

          Preheat oven to 425°F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan.

          and bring it to boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.

          Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust.Gently pour the sugar and
          butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
