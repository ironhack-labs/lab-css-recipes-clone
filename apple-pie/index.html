    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br> quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place <br> prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!</p>

<h4>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br> flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce <br> temperature and let simmer.</li>
    <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
      slightly. Cover with a <br> lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
      that it does not run off.</li>
      <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
        degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
