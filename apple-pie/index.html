        Apple Pie This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen
        another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me
        several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one
        of your favorites as well! Ingredients 1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch
        double crust pie 1/2 cup unsalted butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
        1/4 cup water 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup
        white sugar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 8 Granny Smith apples - peeled,
        cored and sliced Directions Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add
        water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
        temperature and let simmer. Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill
        with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently
        pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it
        does not run off. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the
        temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to
        45 minutes, until apples are soft.
