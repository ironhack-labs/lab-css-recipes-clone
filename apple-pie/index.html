      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br>quite like it. It will always
      be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well! <br>

      <h3>Directions</h3> 
      <ol class="orderlist">
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degreesC). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
          to a boil. Reduce <br>temperature and let simmer.
        </li> 
        <li>
          Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a <br>lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
          that it does not run off. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
        </li>
      </ol>
