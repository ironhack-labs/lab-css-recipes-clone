      <p class="paragraph1">This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
        be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well! </p>

          <p class="paragraph2">Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in     flour to form a paste. Add
            water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
            to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
    
            <p>
              Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
              slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly
              so
              that it does not run off.
            </p> 
    
           <p>
            Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
            degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
