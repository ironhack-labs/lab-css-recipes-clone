    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br> quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place<br> prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!

      <h3 class='titulo'>Directions</h3>
      <section class='preparation'
        <p>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br> flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
        to a boil. Reduce<br> temperature and let simmer.</p>
        <p>2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
        slightly. Cover with a<br> lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
        that it does not run off.</p>
        <p>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
        degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
