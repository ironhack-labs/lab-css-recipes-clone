                This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen
                another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has
                won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope
                it becomes one of your favorites as well!

                        reheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the
                        butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add
                        water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil.
                        Reduce temperature and let simmer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples,
                        mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust.
                        Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust.
                        Pour slowly so that it does not run off.

                    <li>
                        Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the
                        temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue
                        baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
