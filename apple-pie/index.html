    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br> quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place<br> prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    
    <p>1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
      C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br> flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
      to a boil. Reduce<br> temperature and let simmer.<br> Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
      slightly. Cover with a<br> lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
      that it does not run off.<br> Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
