      <article>
      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
      be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well!

        <li>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
            to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li> 

        <li>2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
            slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
            that it does not run off.</li>

        <li>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
            degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
