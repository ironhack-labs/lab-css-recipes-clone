          <p class="info"> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
            be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

        <h3>Directions</h3>
          <p> 1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
          C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
          to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</p>

          <p>2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
          that it does not run off.</p>

          <p>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
            degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
