        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
        one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
        first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

                Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in
                a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white
                sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature
                and let simmer.

            <li>
              <p>
                Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
                slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar
                and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does
                not run off.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to
                350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45
                minutes, until apples are soft.
