          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
          be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
          favorites as well!

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. 
            Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. 
          </p>
          <p>
            2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. 
            Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
          </p>
          <p>
            3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
