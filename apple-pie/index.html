    be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!</p>

  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <ol>
   <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
    C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
    <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
    slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off.</li>
    <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
