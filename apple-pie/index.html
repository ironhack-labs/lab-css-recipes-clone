    <h1>Apple Pie</h1>
    <p>This was my grandmother's page apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
      one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
      prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <p>1) Preheat oven to 425 degress F (220 degress C). Melt the butter in saucepan. Stir
        in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a 
        boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with 
        a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly 
        so that it does not run off.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>3) Bake the 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degress F (175 
        degress C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
