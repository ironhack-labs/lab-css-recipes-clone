        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
        one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
        first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

        <p class="direction">
          1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a
          saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and
          brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
          <br />
          2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
          butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
          <br />3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature
          to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45
          minutes, until apples are soft.
