                This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen
                another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won
                me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it
                becomes one of your favorites as well!
            </p>

                <p>
                    1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the
                    butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water,
                    white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
                    temperature and let simmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
                    slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar
                    and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does
                    not run off.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature
                    to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45
                    minutes, until apples are soft.
