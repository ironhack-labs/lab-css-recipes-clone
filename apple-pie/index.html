      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one 
        quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place 
      prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!

      <section> 1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. 
        <br>Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. </section>
      <section> 2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a 
        <br>lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that 
        <br>it does not run off. </section>
      <section> 3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 
        degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft. </section>
