    <p>
      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
      quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first
      place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well!

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <p>
      1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
      saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown
      sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly.
      Cover with lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid
      over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
      degrees F (175 degrees C).Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until
      apples are soft.
