   <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one</p>
   <p> quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place</p>
    <p>prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well! </p>

      <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. </li>
    <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off. </li>
    <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
