          <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one </br> quite like it. It will always
          be my favorite and has won me several first place</br> prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
          favorites as well!</p>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
          
          1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
          C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour </br>to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
          to a boil. Reduce </br>temperature and let simmer. </br>

          2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a </br>lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so</br>
          that it does not run off. </br>

          3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175</br>
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</br>
