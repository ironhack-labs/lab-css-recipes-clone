        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
        one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
        first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

    Ingredients 1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie 1/2 cup unsalted
    butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup water 3 tablespoons
    all-purpose flour 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup packed brown
    sugar 8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced Directions Preheat
    oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir
    in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. Place the bottom crust in your
    pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust.
    Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that
    it does not run off. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the
    temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45
    minutes, until apples are soft.
