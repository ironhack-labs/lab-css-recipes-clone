    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!</p>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
        </section>
          <ul>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan.
           Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
           to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</ul>
          <ul> 2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
    slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off.</ul>
   <ul> 3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
