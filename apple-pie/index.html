				This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It

				<li>
					Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
					flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
					temperature and let simmer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
					lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
					that it does not run off.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
					degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
