        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
        be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!</div>

      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste.
          Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
          to a boi. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
        <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust.
          Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
          that it does not run off.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue
          baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
      </ul>
