  <p class="intro-text">
    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <div class="directions-list">
      <p> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and
        bring
        to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</p>

      <p> Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
        slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly
        so
        that it does not run off.</p>

      <p> Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue
        baking for 35 to 45 minutes until apples are soft.</p>
