    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br> quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place <br> prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!

  <h4>Directions</h4>
    
    1 &#41; Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in <br> a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce <br> temperature and let simmer. <br>

    2 &#41; Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
    slightly. Cover with a <br> lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
    that it does not run off. <br>

    3 &#41; Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft. <br>
