# LAB | HTML & CSS - Recipes Clone by Joan Carballo

## Introduction

We've only learned the very basics today with HTML and CSS, so what the heck we can really build, right? Wrong, we can build some cool stuff already, and we're going to do just that.

We all have to eat (at least, we should), so let's make some handy recipe pages. We're going to be recreating an Apple Pie recipe. As an extra step, we prepared French Onion Soup recipe as well.

Cloning something that already exists is the best way to get better at front-end development, so check out the deliverable below to see what we're expecting.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Exercise

## Requirements

- [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repo
- Clone this repo
- Make sure you use `class` and `id` selectors throughout your exercise. Remember, only use type selectors if you want to modify *every* element of that type
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - The background with a picture of the apple pie 
  - The recipe servings / nutrients section
  - The prep section

### Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```
Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Starter code

You will be working in the `apple-pie-starter-code` folder. The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and a css file is created in `main.css`.

## Deliverable

Please find a screenshot of the expected results below:

## Extra Practice
If you feel you need more practice, in the `starter-code` you will find `extra-french-soup` folder. There you will find `expected-result.md` file where you can see what is expected from you to build. This folder has the same structure as the the `apple-pie` one so follow the same steps.
